<?php
//Yesterday we covered if & switch statements.
//These are conditional statements that are used to execute code based on a certain condition
// As a way of practicing, we will work on a few exercises

//Remember the syntax is as follows:
//if (condition) {
    //code to be executed if condition is true
//};elseif/else(condition) {
    //code to be executed if condition is false
//};else {
    //code to be executed if all conditions are false
//}

//switch statement syntax is:
//switch(expression) {
    //case (condition):
        //code to be executed if condition is true
        //break;
    //case (condition):
        //code to be executed if condition is true
        //break;
    //default:
     //code to be executed if condition is true
     //break;
//}

//Exercises

//1.An electrical company bills customers based on the amount of electricity they use.
//There are different tariffs for different amounts of electricity.
//The company has a bill for 0-50 kWh  - 100sh per kWh, a bill for 51-100 kWh-150sh per kWh,
//a bill for 101-200 kWh -200sh per kWh, 
//and a bill for 201-300 kWh - 300sh per kWh.
// using operators and conditional statements ,bill a customer who has a consumption of 250kWh
// create one for if and switch

//2.An company has called in an audit firm to  audit their records
// Most employees earn between 50,000 - 500,000
// create a salary groupings for different pay grades
